# Sentiment-Analysis
Overview

This repository contains the code and resources for a sentiment analysis project focused on analyzing customer reviews from the Amazon platform. The project utilizes natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms to classify customer sentiments as positive, negative, or neutral based on textual data.

Key Features

- Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preprocessing of raw textual data, including tokenization, text normalization, and feature extraction.
- Model Development: Building and training machine learning models for sentiment analysis, leveraging algorithms such as logistic regression, support vector machines (SVM), or neural networks.
- Evaluation and Validation: Assessing model performance and accuracy through rigorous evaluation metrics and cross-validation techniques.
- Deployment: Integration of the trained sentiment analysis model into applications or systems for real-time sentiment analysis.

  Usage

-Data Preprocessing: Use scripts in the data/ directory to preprocess raw data before model training.
-Model Development: Explore Jupyter notebooks in the notebooks/ directory for data exploration and model development.
-Model Deployment: Implement model deployment using scripts in the src/ directory.
